I initially joined the [Golden Tiger Kung Fu Academy](https://gtkfa.com/) to learn tai chi and wushu. After I joined, there were exactly 4 people enrolled in the adult class, thus prompting Master Mei if we wanted to learn and perform in lion dancing. I've always been in the crowd spectating the dance, but never the one perfomring. "Why not?", I said.
